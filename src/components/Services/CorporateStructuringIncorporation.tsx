              From a regulatory standpoint, establishing the corporate structure
              of a blockchain-focused startup is arguably one of the most
              critical initial steps. The number and role of entities involved
              must be carefully planned, taking into account the nature of the
              business model, technical operations, customer engagement, and tax
              considerations.
